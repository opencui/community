# üéâ Welcome to OpenCUI community!

A community of builders who are passionate about using OpenCUI to build great chatbots. We are here to help you get the most out of OpenCUI, and we want to make sure that you have the resources you need to succeed.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Here are some tips for getting help on OpenCUI

- **Be self-service.** The first step to getting help is to try to find the answer to your question on your own. The [OpenCUI documentation](https://opencui.io/essentials/) is a great resource, and there are also many helpful articles and tutorials available online.
- **Use community discussions.** If you cannot find the answer to your question in the documentation, try searching for it in the [community discussions](https://github.com/opencui/community/discussions). The community discussions are a great place to ask questions and get help from other builders.
- **File issues.** If you are still stuck, you can file an issue in the community. Issues are a great way to report bugs and get help from the OpenCUI team.

## üí° Here are some additional tips for getting help

- **Be proactive.** Don't wait until you're stuck to start looking for help. The sooner you start looking for help, the sooner you will be able to get back to work.
- **Be specific.** When you're searching for help, be as specific as possible about your issue. The more specific you are, the easier it will be for people to help you.
- **Be patient.** It may take some time to find the answer you're looking for. Don't give up if you don't find the answer right away.
